The software was modified so that you can now specify the initial centers
(this was necessary to apply the global k-means approach).
So, there is now a new optional z option to put right after the data file name.
If no centers are specified, the software uses the k first objects (as in the
original implementation).
Modifications are explicitly indicated in the source code.

example:
./mpi_main -i /.../test.data.txt -z /.../test.centers.txt -n 3
where test.centers.txt is formatted like test.data.txt (see README) but with only k=3 objects
(used as centers).
